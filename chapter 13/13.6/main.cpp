 /* Design an Inventory class that can hold information and calculate data for items in a retail store’s inventory. The class should have the following private member variables:
 Variable Name
itemNumber
quantity
cost
totalCost
Description
An int that holds the item’s item number.
An int for holding the quantity of the items on hand.
A double for holding the wholesale per-unit cost of the item
A double for holding the total inventory cost of the item (cal- culated as quantity times cost).
   The class should have the following public member functions:
 Member Function
Default Constructor Constructor #2
setItemNumber
setQuantity
setCost
setTotalCost
getItemNumber
getQuantity
getCost
getTotalCost
Description
Sets all the member variables to 0.
Accepts an item’s number, cost, and quantity as arguments. The function should copy these values to the appropriate member variables and then call the setTotalCost function.
Accepts an integer argument that is copied to the itemNumber member variable.
Accepts an integer argument that is copied to the quantity member variable.
Accepts a double argument that is copied to the cost member variable.
Calculates the total inventory cost for the item (quantity times cost) and stores the result in totalCost.
Returns the value in itemNumber. Returns the value in quantity. Returns the value in cost. Returns the value in totalCost.
   Demonstrate the class in a driver program.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for item number, quantity, or cost. */
