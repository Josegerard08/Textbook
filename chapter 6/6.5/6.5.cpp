//When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine
//the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
//d = 1/2gt 
//The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t
//is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
//Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) 
//as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval.
//Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments 
//and displays the return value.
